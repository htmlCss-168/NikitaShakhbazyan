        <h1>Bayerische Motoren Werke  - BMW</h1>
        <button id="leftreadmore">Read More</button>
            <p>German multinational manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945.</p>
            <article id="leftarticle">
                The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, which featured a black ring bearing the company name surrounding the company logo, on a plinth a horse's head couped.

                BMW retained Rapp's black ring inscribed with the company name, but adopted as the central element a circular escutcheon bearing a quasi-heraldic reference to the coat of arms (and flag) of the Free State of Bavaria (as the state of their origin was named after 1918), being the arms of the House of Wittelsbach, Dukes and Kings of Bavaria. However, as the local law regarding trademarks forbade the use of state coats of arms or other symbols of sovereignty on commercial logos, the design was sufficiently differentiated to comply, but retained the tinctures azure (blue) and argent (white).
                
                The current iteration of the logo was introduced in 2020, removing 3D effects that had been used in previous renderings of the logo while removing the black outline encircling the rondel. The logo is used for BMW's branding but it is not used on vehicles.

            <h1>The BMW Headquarters</h1>
            <button id="rightreadmore">More Information</button>
            <p>The building has served as the global corporate headquarters of German automaker BMW since 1973. It was declared a protected historic building in 1999, and it is often cited as one of the most notable examples of modern architecture in Munich. Extensive renovations commenced in 2004 and were completed in 2006.</p>
            <article id="rightarticle">
                The Tower was built between 1968 and 1972, and it was ready in time for the 1972 Summer Olympics. The inauguration followed on 18 May 1973. The 101-metre (331 ft) building is located next to the Olympiapark and BMW's main factory. The Tower's exterior is supposed to mimic the shape of four cylinders in a car engine, with the Museum building representing a cylinder head. Both buildings were designed by the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer.

                The Tower consists of four vertical cylinders standing next to and across from each other. Each cylinder is divided horizontally in its center by a mold in the facade. Notably, these cylinders do not stand on the ground; they are suspended on a central support tower. During construction, individual floors were assembled on the ground and then elevated. The Tower has a diameter of 52.30 metres (171.6 ft) and has 22 occupied floors, two of which are basements and 18 of which serve as office space.
